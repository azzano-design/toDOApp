# User stories

As a user if I enter a category - and then start typing - my search will return something in that category.

As a user, I want to be able to make searches before logging in - and save only the search I like to my list and add a time to do it by.

I want to have one todo list - but be able to filter list items by the time I want to complete them by.

I want to be able to edit my todo list - and remove items I've completed or assign them new time to complete them by.

I should be able to change the category for the list item - even after having added it to my list.

I want a reminder for items with a set time - if I have not removed it before that time.

I want additional info about task to be available after I've saved task to my list - but only after I've selected that task.

Finished tasks get saved into timeline for review (feel good) - and prompts to leave review of activity

As a user I want to be notified at the email I set in the users setting
