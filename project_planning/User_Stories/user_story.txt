User stories

As a user if I enter

As a user, I want to be able to make searches before logging in - and save only the search I like to my list and add a time to do it by.

I want to have one todo list - but be able to filter list items by the time I want to complete them by.

I want to be able to edit my todo list - and remove items I've completed or assign them new time to complete them by.

I want a reminder for items with a set time - if I have not removed it before that time.

(Google Keep example) - I want to add other users, to collaborate with -

I want additional info about task to be available after I've saved task to my list - but only after I've selected that task.

Finished tasks get saved into timeline for review (feel good) - and prompts to leave review of activity
